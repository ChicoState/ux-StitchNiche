# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

In this second spirit the UX team used two methods to gather information on the current state of the Stitch Niche Application and how it meets user needs and expectations. Below outlines the methods in which this research was conducted. 

The first of these methods was receiving informal feedback of Stitch Niche following the completion of the first sprint. The Stitch Niche Software Engineering team performed a demonstration of the application to their class of other Software Engineering students (n = 65). The demonstration utilized a set of predetermined inputs that would be used to show how the application generates rectangular patterns. The results of this feedback are discussed in later sections.

The second research method was a cognitive walkthrough. The cognitive walkthrough was performed externally by Usability Engineering students separate from the Stitch Niche UX team utilizing Wireframes and previously created Personas and Scenarios.

To perform the cognitive walkthrough the evaluators (n = 3) were given the persona “Lily” as well as the specific goal to make a scarf. The evaluator would use this goal and the assumed knowledge base of the persona to go step by step through the process using the wireframes as a guide to simulate the application. In a document, evaluators would answer two questions
following each step made in their process.

* Will the user know what to do at this step?
* If the user does the right thing, will the user know that they did the right thing and is making progress toward the goal?

Once finished  evaluators then submitted the completed documentation to the Stitch Niche UX team for review.

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
