# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

Stitch Niche is an application designed to assist with resizing and designing crochet and knitting patterns. Stitch Niche will help those of all skill levels be able to customize their patterns to fit their needs. Stitch niche is unique because it tackles the difficult task of resizing patterns that often requires a great deal of time and effort to do the calculations. This application hopes to make working on the projects you want to make a little easier!

In this first sprint, the Stitch Niche team focused on implementing the ability to generate or resize a rectangular pattern for either crochet or knitting. Below the UX team has outlined the research and outcomes of their contributions in this first sprint.


## Methods

When the Stitch Niche team first began work on the project we began by first taking some time to research what crochet and knitting are in general. We did this by reading over the notes that were provided by the software engineering team and doing some general searching online for information such as: What is a stitch? What is the difference between crochet and knitting? Why is it difficult to resize patterns? And so forthâ€¦ This small amount of initial research helped prepare us for the rest of our research.

When we began work on our first official research task we conducted a Competitive Analysis on five different applications for Stitch Niche. Competitive analysis is a research tactic that takes an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of current/potential competitors for the application you plan to develop. Each of the competitors the UX team  looked at were judged on five different categories: Strengths, Weaknesses, Quality, Price, and Platform. This was then compiled into a table that displayed each of the competitors side by side. This can be seen in the table below.

The second form of research we did was a heuristic evaluation of one specific competitor for Stitch Niche where we decided on Stitch Fiddle. The UX team chose to examine Stitch Fiddle due to its easy access, but the also plethora of features and its similarity to desired features for Stitch Niche. A heuristic evaluation is a method of determining usability problems in an application by comparing it to a strict set of guidelines. We perform this evaluation to avoid these issues within our project and find ways to improve.

Those guidelines were as follows:
 * Visibility of System Status
 * Match between the system and the real world
  *User control and freedom
 * Consistency and standards
 * Error prevention
*  Recognition rather than recall
*  Flexibility and efficiency of use
*  Aesthetic and minimalist design
*  Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
*  Help and documentation

For each category, we provided a rating between 1-10 with 10 being that it performs that functionally well and 1 being it does not at all. Overall Stitch Fiddle was rated as a 7/10 based on the above requirements. This was mostly due to the very layered and simple UI that could be confusing and the user being restricted by not having an account despite it being an open webpage.

Using the results of this research we began work on our initial designs and planning with our team creating a variety of artifacts including user stories and concept art which are further analyzed in the next section and can be viewed on the main page.


## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
